\section*{Part (a): DAXPY Loop, No Unrolling, with No Scheduling}
The timing diagram is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:a}. The timing diagram is also submitted as 4DM4-Assignment-\#2a-Basic-Timing-Table-Group-47-RH,AP.xlsx. The performance, or MFLOP rating, of the implementation with a 3 GHz clock is (3 GHz)*(2 FLOP/19 cc) = 315.8 MFLOP/s.
