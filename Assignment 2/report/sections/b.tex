\section*{Part (b): DAXPY Loop, No Unrolling, with Scheduling}
The timing diagram is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:b}. The timing diagram is also included in the submission as 4DM4-Assignment-\#2b-Basic-Timing-Table.xlsx. The performance, or MFLOP rating, of the implementation with a 3 GHz clock is (3 GHz)*(2 FLOP/13 cc) = 461.5 MFLOP/s.
